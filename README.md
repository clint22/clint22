# 🧐 About
I love building good quality software. I aim to create happiness for the users who are eventually using the software I’m creating, and also I enjoy secret pleasure in writing clean code. 

I am very fortunate and lucky to become a software developer. I have no shame in admitting that. My career would have been somewhere else If I hadn’t got the taste of creation and innovation in developing software during my college days.

I feel like the fast-changing world of mobile development gives me tons of opportunities to learn new things at a flashing speed and put it into practice. 

I try to give it back to the developer community as much as I can. Even if it is sharing or learning something with my colleague or other developers, it makes me happy. Having said that, I own a Youtube channel where I talk about Kotlin and Android in general. Also, I try to blog at times about the new challenges I face while developing Android apps or about silly bugs we meet every day. 

Good day to you.
